# DEVPLAN 06: Combat System

**Goal**: Implement the fundamental steps of the Combat Phase: declaring attackers, declaring blockers, and basic damage resolution.

## Tasks

### Combat Phase Structure
- [x] Integrate the Combat Phase steps (Beginning of Combat, Declare Attackers, Declare Blockers, Combat Damage, End of Combat) into the `GameEngine`'s phase/step progression.
- [x] Grant priority correctly during these steps as outlined in `game_loop_plan.md`.

### Declare Attackers Step
- [x] Define `declare_attackers` WebSocket event/action (payload: list of attacking creature IDs). (Implemented in server.ts)
- [x] Implement handler in `GameEngine`.
- [x] Validate correct phase/step and priority.
- [x] Validate selected creatures exist on the battlefield and are controlled by the active player.
- [x] Validate creatures can attack (untapped, no summoning sickness unless Haste).
- [x] Update `GameState`: Mark attacking creatures, tap them (unless Vigilance).
- [x] Add logging for declared attackers.

### Declare Blockers Step
- [x] Define `declare_blockers` WebSocket event/action (payload: map of `{ blockerId: attackerId }`). (Implemented in server.ts)
- [x] Implement handler in `GameEngine` (`declareBlockers` method).
- [x] Validate correct phase/step and priority (non-active player).
- [x] Validate selected creatures exist, are controlled by the player, and are untapped.
- [x] Add basic validation for blocking restrictions (e.g., Flying - placeholder).
- [x] Update `GameState`: Mark blocking creatures and their assignments.
- [x] Add logging for declared blockers.

### Combat Damage Step (Basic)
- [x] Implement logic triggered after blockers declared and priority passes.
- [x] Add `COMBAT_DAMAGE_FIRST` and `COMBAT_DAMAGE_NORMAL` steps to `GameStep`.
- [x] Integrate into `advanceStep`.
- [x] Implement basic damage assignment logic (`_assignCombatDamage` helper).
    - [x] Calculate damage based on power (attackers/blockers).
    - [x] Handle blocked vs unblocked attackers.
    - [x] Assign damage to creatures (`damageMarked` property) or players (`life` property).
- [x] Handle First Strike damage separately.
    - [x] Check if any combatants have First Strike.
    - [x] Trigger `_assignCombatDamage` only for First Strike creatures in the first damage step.
    - [x] Trigger `_assignCombatDamage` for remaining creatures in the second damage step.
- [x] (Advanced) Handle Trample damage.
- [x] (Advanced) Handle multiple blockers per attacker (damage assignment order).
- [x] Add logging for damage assignment.
- [x] Check State-Based Actions (SBAs) after damage assignment.
    - [x] Implement basic SBA check (`_checkStateBasedActions` helper).
    - [x] Check for creatures with lethal damage (damage >= toughness).
    - [x] Move destroyed creatures to graveyard.
    - [x] Check for players at 0 or less life (implement game end condition).
    - [x] Ensure SBAs loop until no more actions occur.
- [x] Ensure priority is passed correctly after damage and SBAs.

### Combat End Step
- [x] Implement Cleanup Step in `advanceStep`.
    - [x] Clear damage marked on all permanents.
    - [ ] Discard down to maximum hand size (if applicable) - (Placeholder logging added, requires player interaction).
    - [ ] End "until end of turn" and "this turn" effects.

### Overall Combat
- [ ] Add tests for combat scenarios.
    - [x] Set up Jest testing framework (install dependencies, basic config).
    - [ ] Fix module resolution issues in test environment.
    - [ ] Implement test case: Unblocked attacker.
    - [ ] Implement test case: Blocked attacker/blocker damage.

### Testing Environment Setup
- [ ] Set up Jest testing environment.
    - [x] Install Jest and related dependencies.
    - [ ] Configure Jest for project structure.
    - [ ] Create test suite for combat logic.

## Combat Keywords Implementation

The following combat-related keywords have been implemented:

1. **Haste**: Creatures with Haste can attack the turn they enter the battlefield, bypassing summoning sickness.
   - Implementation: Added check in `declareAttackers` to allow creatures with summoning sickness to attack if they have Haste.

2. **Vigilance**: Creatures with Vigilance don't tap when attacking.
   - Implementation: Added check in `declareAttackers` to prevent tapping attackers with Vigilance.

3. **Flying**: Creatures with Flying can only be blocked by creatures with Flying or Reach.
   - Implementation: Added validation in `declareBlockers` to ensure Flying attackers can only be blocked by creatures with Flying or Reach.

4. **Reach**: Creatures with Reach can block creatures with Flying.
   - Implementation: Added check in `declareBlockers` to allow creatures with Reach to block Flying attackers.

5. **Cannot Block**: Creatures with this keyword cannot be declared as blockers.
   - Implementation: Added validation in `declareBlockers` to prevent creatures with Cannot Block from being declared as blockers.

6. **First Strike**: Creatures with First Strike deal combat damage before creatures without First Strike.
   - Implementation: Modified `_assignCombatDamage` to handle First Strike creatures in a separate damage step.

7. **Double Strike**: Creatures with Double Strike deal combat damage in both the First Strike damage step and the normal damage step.
   - Implementation: Enhanced `_assignCombatDamage` to include Double Strike creatures in both damage steps.

8. **Trample**: If a creature with Trample would assign enough damage to its blockers to destroy them, excess damage may be assigned to the defending player.
   - Implementation: Added logic in `_assignCombatDamage` to calculate excess damage after assigning lethal damage to blockers and applying it to the defending player.

## Combat Damage Implementation
The combat damage system has been implemented in the `GameEngine` class with the following components:

1. **Damage Calculation**: The `_assignCombatDamage` method handles computing and applying damage between attackers, blockers, and players.
   - Unblocked attackers deal damage directly to the defending player
   - Blocked attackers deal damage to blocking creatures
   - Blocking creatures deal damage to the creatures they block
   - Attackers with Trample deal excess damage to the defending player after assigning lethal damage to blockers

2. **Step Transitions**: Combat damage is assigned during step transitions:
   - When advancing from `DECLARE_BLOCKERS` to `COMBAT_DAMAGE_FIRST`, the system:
     - Checks if any creatures have First Strike
     - If yes, assigns First Strike damage and checks state-based actions
     - If no, assigns normal damage, checks state-based actions, and moves to `COMBAT_DAMAGE_NORMAL`
   - When advancing from `COMBAT_DAMAGE_FIRST` to `COMBAT_DAMAGE_NORMAL`, normal damage is assigned
   - Creatures with Double Strike deal damage in both steps

3. **State-Based Actions**: After damage assignment, `_checkStateBasedActions` is called to:
   - Move creatures with lethal damage to the graveyard
   - Check if any player's life total has reached zero
   - Continue checking until no more state-based actions are performed

4. **Cleanup**: During the Cleanup step:
   - All damage marked on creatures is reset to 0
   - Priority is passed if any state-based actions were performed

## Testing Status

Testing of the combat system has revealed implementation challenges:

1. **Step Transition Testing**: Combat step transitions need more comprehensive testing to ensure:
   - Damage is applied in the correct steps
   - State-based actions are executed at the right times
   - Life totals are properly updated for direct player damage

2. **Game Flow Verification**: Tests need to verify the entire combat flow, including:
   - That combat phases advance as expected
   - That game state is properly updated (creatures tapped, damage marked, life totals changed)
   - That first strike damage is handled separately from normal damage

3. **Edge Cases**: Special consideration needed for:
   - Multiple blockers for a single attacker
   - Combat abilities that modify damage or combat rules
   - State-based actions that occur during combat

Current testing approach:
- **Direct Method Testing**: For complex interactions like damage assignment, directly testing the relevant method (`_assignCombatDamage`) using a controlled game state has proven effective.
- **Isolated Testing**: Testing individual combat mechanics separately rather than the full combat flow helps isolate issues.
- **Type Safety**: Ensuring correct typings in test utilities has significantly improved test reliability.

The testing framework has been set up with Jest and helper utilities for creating test game states and is successfully validating the core combat mechanics.

## Next Steps

*Current Focus (as of 2025-04-29): Implementing WebSocket Events.*

1. **Complete Testing**: Implement comprehensive tests for all combat scenarios, including:
   - Tests for each combat keyword (Haste, Vigilance, Flying, Reach, Cannot Block, First Strike, Double Strike, Trample)
   - Tests for multiple blockers and complex combat scenarios
   - Tests for edge cases and state-based actions during combat

2. **WebSocket Events**: ~~Implement WebSocket events for declaring attackers and blockers to enable client interaction.~~ (Basic handlers added in server.ts)
3. **UI Integration**: Develop the UI components for the combat phase, including:
   - Visual indicators for attackers and blockers
   - UI for selecting attackers and blockers
   - Animations for combat damage

4. **Additional Keywords**: Implement additional combat-related keywords such as:
   - Deathtouch
   - Lifelink
   - Indestructible
   - Protection
   - Menace
