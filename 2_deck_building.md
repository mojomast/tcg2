# 2. Deck Building & Card System

## Deck Construction Rules

Building a balanced and effective deck is a critical aspect of Badass TCG. The following rules govern deck construction:

### Core Rules

| Parameter | Standard Format | Quick Format | Tournament Format |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Minimum Deck Size | 60 cards | 40 cards | 60 cards |
| Maximum Deck Size | No limit (but recommended â‰¤90) | 60 cards | 80 cards |
| Resource Generator Ratio | ~40% (24+ for 60-card deck) | ~40% (16+ for 40-card deck) | ~40% (24+ for 60-card deck) |
| Card Copy Limits | Max 4 copies of any card | Max 3 copies of any card | Max 4 copies of any card |
| Sideboard Size | 15 cards | None | 15 cards |
| Banned/Restricted List | See current ban list | See current ban list | See current ban list |

### Color Identity Rules

Color identity refers to the alignment of a card with specific mana types (as detailed in [Game Mechanics](1_game_mechanics.md)).

1. **Pure Decks**: Focus on a single mana color, providing consistency but limiting options
2. **Dual-Color Decks**: Combine two complementary colors for more versatile strategies
3. **Multi-Color Decks**: Three or more colors enable powerful combinations but increase risk of resource scarcity
4. **Colorless Cards**: Can be included in any deck regardless of color identity

### Deck Archetypes

+---------------+     +---------------+     +---------------+
|               |     |               |     |               |
|   AGGRO       |     |   CONTROL     |     |   COMBO       |
|   Fast        |     |   Slow        |     |   Variable    |
|   Low Cost    |     |   Defensive   |     |   Specific    |
|   Direct      |     |   Disruptive  |     |   Synergistic |
|               |     |               |     |               |
+---------------+     +---------------+     +---------------+

+---------------+     +---------------+
|               |     |               |
|   MIDRANGE    |     |   HYBRID      |
|   Balanced    |     |   Flexible    |
|   Adaptive    |     |   Multiple    |
|   Resilient   |     |   Strategies  |
|               |     |               |
+---------------+     +---------------+
```

Each archetype favors specific card types, costs, and strategies:

- **Aggro**: Low-cost creatures, direct damage spells, minimal resource generators
- **Control**: Counterspells, removal, card draw, higher resource generator count
- **Combo**: Card draw, tutors (card search), combo pieces, protection spells
- **Midrange**: Efficient creatures, removal, flexible answers, balanced resource distribution
- **Hybrid**: Combines elements from multiple archetypes for unpredictability
