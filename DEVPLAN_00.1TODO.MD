# DEVPLAN_00.1TODO.MD: Comprehensive Development Roadmap

**Created:** 2025-05-30  
**Status:** Active Master TODO List  
**Objective:** Complete all backend features in the UI and finish remaining core systems for a fully playable TCG

      - **Fix Applied**: Updated import to use client GameState from `gameSlice.ts` instead of server interface
      - **Files Modified**: `src/components/GameOverModal.tsx` (import statement)
  4. ‚úÖ `src/components/OpponentBattlefield.tsx:32:60 - error TS2322: ... Property 'isTapped' does not exist`
      - **Fix Applied**: Updated CardComponent props to use `cardLocation="battlefield"` and `isOwner={false}`
      - **Files Modified**: `src/components/OpponentBattlefield.tsx` (CardComponent props)
- **Validation**: 
  - ‚úÖ `npm run build` passes with exit code 0
