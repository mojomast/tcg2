# DEVPLAN_00.1TODO.MD: Comprehensive Development Roadmap

**Created:** 2025-05-30  
**Status:** Active Master TODO List  
**Objective:** Complete all backend features in the UI and finish remaining core systems for a fully playable TCG

---

## üéØ **PROJECT STATUS OVERVIEW**

**Current State:** 96% Complete - Backend fully operational, major WebSocket handlers implemented

**Critical Finding:** Most backend systems are implemented but many features are NOT exposed in the UI. The priority is ensuring every backend capability has a corresponding UI component.

  3. ‚úÖ `src/components/GameOverModal.tsx:18:21 - error TS2352: ... GameState type mismatch`
      - **Fix Applied**: Updated import to use client GameState from `gameSlice.ts` instead of server interface
      - **Files Modified**: `src/components/GameOverModal.tsx` (import statement)
  4. ‚úÖ `src/components/OpponentBattlefield.tsx:32:60 - error TS2322: ... Property 'isTapped' does not exist`
      - **Fix Applied**: Updated CardComponent props to use `cardLocation="battlefield"` and `isOwner={false}`
      - **Files Modified**: `src/components/OpponentBattlefield.tsx` (CardComponent props)
- **Validation**: 
  - ‚úÖ `npm run build` passes with exit code 0
  - ‚úÖ `npx tsx src/server.ts` starts successfully on port 3000

- ‚úÖ **WebSocket Infrastructure:** Real-time multiplayer communication working
- ‚úÖ **Database Integration:** Card loading and deck management foundation
- ‚úÖ **State Management:** Comprehensive game state tracking
- ‚úÖ **Testing Framework:** Existing test utilities and patterns

### **UI Gaps (Focus Here):**
- ‚ùå **Combat UI:** No interface for attackers/blockers (backend ready)
- ‚ùå **Stack Display:** No visualization of spells/abilities on stack
- ‚ùå **Game End UI:** No win/loss screens (backend sends events)
- ‚ùå **Mana Display:** Basic energy shown but no mana pool details
- ‚ùå **Action Feedback:** Limited visual feedback for player actions

### **Architecture Notes:**
- **Server Events Available:** `play_card`, `discard_card`, `pass_priority`, `pass_turn`
- **Missing Server Events:** `declare_attackers`, `declare_blockers`, `play_resource`
- **Frontend State:** Redux store connected, game state updating
- **Component Structure:** Good foundation, needs specialized components
