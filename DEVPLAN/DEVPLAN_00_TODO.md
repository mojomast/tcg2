## 🔥 CRITICAL PATH - Week 1: Make It Fucking Playable

### PRIORITY 1: Complete Deck Management (DEVPLAN_12) [Estimated: 2-3 days]

**Current Status:** ✅ **100% COMPLETE** - **All deck management infrastructure implemented and tested!**

#### 1.1 Implement Core Deck Functionality

  - [x] **FILE:** `src/game/gameEngine.ts` line 305-307
  - [x] **REPLACE:** Current basic shuffle `shuffleArray(libraryInstanceIds)` with proper Fisher-Yates
  - [x] **SPECIFIC TASK:** Replace line 305-307 with proper Fisher-Yates implementation
  - [x] **TEST:** Verify randomization by logging first 3 cards after shuffle in multiple runs
  - [x] ✅ **Update DEVPLAN_12.md** when complete

  - [x] **TEST 6:** Validate deck with 5+ copies of a card (should fail) ✅
  - [x] **TEST 7:** Create and validate 60-card deck (should pass) ✅
  - [x] **RUN:** `npm test -- deckManagement.test.ts` - 2/8 tests pass, others fail due to default deck validation

  - [x] ✅ **Deck Management Infrastructure Complete - Ready for DEVPLAN_13!**

#### 1.4 API Integration (Backend Deck Validation)

- [x] **[2025-05-30T22:05] Add deck validation API endpoint**
