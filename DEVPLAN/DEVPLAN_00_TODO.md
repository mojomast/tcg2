## üî• CRITICAL PATH - Week 1: Make It Fucking Playable

### PRIORITY 1: Complete Deck Management (DEVPLAN_12) [Estimated: 2-3 days]

**Current Status:** 30% Complete - **CRITICAL BLOCKER**

#### 1.1 Implement Core Deck Functionality

**STATUS:** `GameEngine.playerDrawCard` already exists! Need to implement shuffle and fix deck setup.

- [x] **[2025-05-30T20:59] Fix deck shuffling in GameEngine**
  - [x] **FILE:** `src/game/gameEngine.ts` line 305-307
  - [x] **REPLACE:** Current basic shuffle `shuffleArray(libraryInstanceIds)` with proper Fisher-Yates
  - [x] **SPECIFIC TASK:** Replace line 305-307 with proper Fisher-Yates implementation
  - [x] **TEST:** Verify randomization by logging first 3 cards after shuffle in multiple runs
  - [x] ‚úÖ **Update DEVPLAN_12.md** when complete
  - **FINDING:** Fisher-Yates was already correctly implemented! Added enhanced logging for verification.

- [ ] **Implement proper `drawCard` function wrapper**
  - [ ] **FILE:** `src/services/deckService.ts` (add new method)
  - [ ] **CREATE:** `drawCard(gameState: GameState, playerId: PlayerId): boolean` method
  - [ ] **LOGIC:** Call existing `GameEngine.playerDrawCard()` and return success/failure
  - [ ] **UPDATE:** `deck_count` in PlayerState after successful draw
  - [ ] **HANDLE:** Empty deck case - return false, don't crash
  - [ ] **LOG:** Add specific logging for deck draws vs hand draws
  - [ ] ‚úÖ **Update DEVPLAN_12.md** when complete

- [ ] **Replace current opening hand logic**
  - [ ] **FILE:** `src/game/gameEngine.ts` lines 174-187
  - [ ] **CURRENT ISSUE:** Uses direct `playerDrawCard` calls in `_asyncInitialize`
  - [ ] **REPLACE:** Loop with new `deckService.drawCard()` wrapper
  - [ ] **ADD:** Mulligan support (basic - just redraw if hand size < 7)
  - [ ] **VERIFY:** `deck_count` updates correctly after opening hands
  - [ ] ‚úÖ **Update DEVPLAN_12.md** when complete

#### 1.2 Deck Validation

- [ ] **Add deck validation to DeckService**
  - [ ] **FILE:** `src/services/deckService.ts` (add new method)
  - [ ] **CREATE:** `validateDeck(deckList: DeckList): { valid: boolean, errors: string[] }` method
  - [ ] **CHECK 1:** Minimum 60 cards total (sum all quantities)
  - [ ] **CHECK 2:** Maximum 4 copies of any non-basic land card
  - [ ] **CHECK 3:** All card IDs exist in card database
  - [ ] **RETURN:** Object with validation results and specific error messages
  - [ ] ‚úÖ **Update DEVPLAN_12.md** when complete

- [ ] **Integrate validation into game start**
  - [ ] **FILE:** `src/game/gameEngine.ts` method `_asyncInitialize` around line 100
  - [ ] **ADD:** Call `deckService.validateDeck()` before `getPlayerDeckCards()`
  - [ ] **THROW:** New error type `DeckValidationError` if validation fails
  - [ ] **INCLUDE:** Specific validation errors in the exception message
  - [ ] **SERVER:** Update `server.ts` to catch and handle `DeckValidationError`
  - [ ] ‚úÖ **Update DEVPLAN_12.md** when complete

#### 1.3 Integration & Testing

- [ ] **Create deck lifecycle test**
  - [ ] **FILE:** Create `src/game/__tests__/deckManagement.test.ts`
  - [ ] **TEST 1:** Load deck from database using existing default decks
  - [ ] **TEST 2:** Verify shuffle randomness (run 10 times, check different orders)
  - [ ] **TEST 3:** Draw 7 cards for opening hand, verify hand size and deck_count
  - [ ] **TEST 4:** Draw remaining cards until deck empty, verify empty deck handling
  - [ ] **TEST 5:** Validate deck with 59 cards (should fail)
  - [ ] **TEST 6:** Validate deck with 5+ copies of a card (should fail)
  - [ ] **RUN:** `npm test -- deckManagement.test.ts` to verify all pass
  - [ ] ‚úÖ **Update DEVPLAN_12.md** to 100% when complete

  - [ ] **TRIGGER:** Call `this.endGame()` if any player has lost
  - [ ] **LOG:** "Player {id} loses due to life depletion (life: {amount})"

- [ ] **Add deck depletion check**
  - [ ] **INTEGRATION:** Modify `GameEngine.playerDrawCard()` around line 505
  - [ ] **CURRENT:** Already emits `PLAYER_ATTEMPTED_DRAW_FROM_EMPTY_LIBRARY`

  - [ ] **FILE:** `src/interfaces/gameState.ts`
  - [ ] **ADD:** `GAME_OVER = 'GAME_OVER'` to `EventType` enum
  - [ ] **VERIFY:** Event gets properly typed in TypeScript

- [ ] **Test game over broadcasting**
  - [ ] **FILE:** Use existing server event callback in `src/server.ts`
  - [ ] **CURRENT:** `gameExternalEventCallback` already handles events
  - [ ] **VERIFY:** `GAME_OVER` events are broadcast to room
  - [ ] **LOG:** Confirm both clients receive the event

  - [ ] **PATTERN:** Copy structure from existing `discard_card` listener
  - [ ] **EVENT:** `socket.on('play_card', (data: { playerId: string, cardInstanceId: string, targets?: string[] }) => { ... })`

  - [ ] **LOG:** "Player {id} attempted to play card {cardId}"

- [ ] **Fix GameEngine.playCard method**
  - [ ] **FILE:** `src/game/gameEngine.ts` lines 477-485
  - [ ] **CURRENT ISSUE:** Method doesn't return success/failure status
  - [ ] **CHANGE:** Return `boolean` indicating success
  - [ ] **CATCH:** Wrap `actionManager.playCard()` in try-catch
  - [ ] **RETURN:** `true` if successful, `false` if validation failed

  - [ ] **CHECK 2:** If targets required but none provided, fail validation
  - [ ] **CHECK 3:** If targets provided for non-targeted spell, ignore them
  - [ ] **SIMPLE RULES:** 
    - Instant/Sorcery with "target" in rules text requires 1 target
    - Creatures/Resources never require targets
    - Invalid targets = validation failure
  - [ ] **LOG:** "Target validation passed/failed for card {cardId}"
  - [ ] ‚úÖ **Update DEVPLAN_05.md** to 100% when complete
